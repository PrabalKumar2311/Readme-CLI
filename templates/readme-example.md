## 📈 Recent Achievements & Changes

### ✅ Config Refactor & Thread Safety

- Replaced hardcoded config with a robust, thread-safe, globally accessible `ConfigManager`.
- Added support for loading config from `config.json` and overriding via CLI arguments.
- All modules now use config values (API keys, symbols, thresholds, etc.) from the config manager.
- Fixed a critical deadlock bug in config access by switching to `std::recursive_mutex`.
- Unit tests for config and thread safety now pass.

### ✅ Trade Execution Pipeline

- Integrated `TradeExecutor` with REST API connectors for Binance and OKX.
- Supports both dry-run (simulated) and live trading modes.
- Risk checks and logging for all trade attempts.

### ✅ Production-Grade Reliability

- No more infinite loops or deadlocks at startup or in tests.
- Robust error handling, reconnection, and data validation.
- Clean shutdown on interrupt.

## 🚀 Build & Run

**Requirements:**

- CMake 3.20+
- C++20-compatible compiler
- Dependencies: Boost, OpenSSL, nlohmann/json, spdlog  
  (Install via Homebrew or vcpkg)
- Standalone Asio (vendored in `third_party/asio`)

**Build Steps:**

```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

**Run:**

```sh
./goquant [--config config.json] [--dry-run] [other CLI options]
```

- Loads configuration from `config.json` (or file specified via `--config`).
- All engine parameters (API keys, symbols, thresholds, etc.) are now configurable.
- Connects to Binance and OKX, logs best bid/ask and mark price for all enabled symbols in real time.
- Detects and logs arbitrage opportunities between Binance spot and OKX synthetic spot.
- Press CTRL+C to exit cleanly.
